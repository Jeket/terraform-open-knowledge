## Introduction
This repository serves as an online course for learning Terraform. 
Made by [STRV](https://www.strv.com/), it’s here to help those who want to use Terraform to "code" infrastructure.

#### Goal
To give you a fundamental understanding of what Terraform is, and how to use it in your project.

The presenter demonstrated the best practices in Terraform—experience he gained by working on numerous projects.

#### Source
This online course was created by utilizing material from an **internal workshop held at [STRV](https://www.strv.com/)**.

#### Prerequisites
This course requires at least basic knowledge of backend development and basic experience with cloud (AWS).

## Contents
